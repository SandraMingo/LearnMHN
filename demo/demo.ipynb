    "### Choosing the MHN framework\n",
    "One can use either the classical MHN framework (**cMHN**, discussed in __[Schill et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz513)__) or the observation-aware MHN framework (**oMHN**, discussed in __[Schill et al. 2024](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.03.569824v1)__).<br><br> In brief, the conceptual difference is that oMHN explicitly includes the observation itself as an event. In other words, the time at which a cancer exits (recorded) progression by being observed is dependent on the events that it accumulated before. In contrast, in cMHN this dependence does not exist and instead observation times simply follow an exponential distribution. In practice, choosing oMHN generally does not substantially affect performance in terms of fitting the data, but it likely increases soundness and interpretability of the inferred model parameters. **Thus, we would recommend oMHN in most scenarios.** <br><br>\n",

    "### Choosing the regularization penalty\n",
    "\n",
    "Like most machine learning models, MHN uses regularization during the training process. In brief, regularization means penalising the parameter inference so that a sparse (parsimonious) set of parameters is generally preferred. In other words, it aims at explaining the training input data well, with as little parameters as possible, to keep the model generalisable to test data. While the *strength* of the regularization penalty is determined later during cross-validation, we now have to decide on the *form* of regularization. <br><br>\n",
    "There are two forms of penalty currently implemented for MHN, a **standard L1-penalty** and a **custom symmetrical penalty**. The L1-penalty is a standard approach in machine learning and keeps each parameter uniformly close to 0. In contrast, the symmetrical penalty restricts pairs of parameters simultaneously, specifically pairs which are symmetrical in Θ with respect to the diagonal. Having one such pair of parameters at a nonzero value is as costly as having only one of them at the same value. This is further discussed in __[Schill et al. 2024](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.03.569824v1)__. **We recommend to choose the penalty based on prior knowledge about the structure of effects that are expected in the type of data one is working with. For mutational data as in this notebook, we recommend the symmetrical penalty as it is likely more in line with the nature of epistatic effects between driver mutations.**<br><br>\n",
    "In terms of code, this decision is made by calling the respective penalty-setting function. In our example, we set the L1-penalty for the cMHN run and the symmetrical penalty for the oMHN run:"

    "- `'init': ...` - tells us about the initial state of Θ at the start of training. By default (`'init': None`), MHN initializes training with the \"independence model\" - in which the diagonal entries of Θ are simply set to the emprical odds and the rest of Θ is empty. Alternatively, users have the option to specify some prior parameterization of Θ using the `set_init_theta()` function.\n",
    "- `'lambda': ...` - just shows us the input regularization strength we previously determined through CV.\n",
    "- `'maxit': ...` - is the specified maximum number of gradient steps before the training is automatically terminated (default: 5000). \n",
    "- `'message': ...` - is the termination message obtained internally from `scipy.optimize.minimize()`. `CONVERGENCE: REL_REDUCTION_OF_F_<=_FACTR*EPSMCH` is the expected value, which means that the optimization terminated successfully due to parameter convergence. In case other values pop up here, the __[scipy documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html)__ should be consulted. \n",
    "- `'nit': ...` - tells us about the number of gradient steps taken before termination.\n",
    "- `'reltol': ...` - informs us about the input upper bound for parameter changes that are still considered as converged, see the __[scipy documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.minimize-bfgs.html#optimize-minimize-bfgs)__. This parameter can be changed from default (1e-07) in the `train()` function but we advise inexperienced users not to do so. \n",
    "- `'score': ...` - informs us about the input data likelihood under the final model. Specifically, it shows the negative logarithm of the sum of likelihoods over all observations (to be minimized during training - the lower, the better). \n",
    "- `'status': ...` - ???\n",

    "Comparing the two matrices, they look quite different at the first glance. Some differences are due to choice of penalty form (L1 vs symmetrical) and some others are due to choice of framework (cMHN vs oMHN). For instance, we can see that the positive relationship between STK11 and KEAP1 is explained by a unidirectional, strong effect with the L1 penalty while it is explained by symmetric, bidirectional and more moderate effects with the symmetrical penalty. In general, the symmetrical-penalty-trained oMHN is (expectedly) much more symmetric.<br> <br>\n",
    "Furthermore, we can see that the cMHN heatmap has many more negative effects. This is likely because there is a lot of statistical mutual exclusivity in the data that needs to be explained by cMHN. For instance, EGFR is often observed alone or just with 1-2 co-mutations. cMHN can explain this pattern only by introducing negative rate changes between EGFR and other events. oMHN instead can alternatively explain this pattern by fitting an observation-rate-increasing effect to EGFR - in other words, EGFR is often lonely not because it suppresses other events, but because the respective tumor likely becomes observed before other events can accumulate."
